# Definition in Scala
## Class
Classes in Scala are blueprints for creating objects. They can contain methods, values, variables, types, objects, traits, and classes which are collectively called members. Types, objects, and traits will be covered later in the tour.
```
class User

val user1 = new User
```

# Trait
Traits are used to share interfaces and fields between classes. They are similar to Java 8â€™s interfaces. Classes and objects can extend traits but traits cannot be instantiated and therefore have no parameters.

```
trait Iterator[A] {
  def hasNext: Boolean
  def next(): A
}

class IntIterator(to: Int) extends Iterator[Int] {
  private var current = 0
  override def hasNext: Boolean = current < to
  override def next(): Int =  {
    if (hasNext) {
      val t = current
      current += 1
      t
    } else 0
  }
}


val iterator = new IntIterator(10)
iterator.next()  // returns 0
iterator.next()  // returns 1
```
